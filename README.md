# Hangman-with-Turtle-for-Teaching
The game Hangman with Python turtle incorporated to draw the stick figures. Hangman main.py not my own, but draw.py was created by me to use with my students.
Contains teaching notes and things to remind students.

A blank file was used in class to code along with the students. "empty_draw.py" was used for students to fill in depending if a class needed it to save time.
